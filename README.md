# Authorization-Code-Flow
The Authorization Code Flow (defined in OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749, section 4.1), involves exchanging an authorization code for a token.  This flow can only be used for confidential applications (such as Regular Web Applications) because the application's authentication methods are included in the exchange and must be kept secure.
